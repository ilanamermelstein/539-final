        <div>
        <p>Ilana is a first-year MSI student at the University of Michigan concentrating in UX Research. In her coursework, she has discovered an interest in programming, which is why she decided to create a game for her final web design project.</p><br>
        <p>Ilana is not only a student, UX Researcher, and novice programmer, but a proud theater kid. She acted, sang, and danced in musicals from age 7 to age 14. Although she no longer participates as a cast member, she still loves seeing musicals at the University of Michigan, listening to Broadway Original Cast Recordings, and stays up to date on the news in the theater world</p><br>
        <p>Ilana's longstanding love for theater and new interest in programming inspired her to make a game related to Broadway musicals, and thus, MusicalGuessr was born!</p>

        <h2>The Program</h2>
        <div>
        <p>MusicalGuessr was developed as a final project for SI 539 - Web Design: Responsiveness and Accessibility. The site was coded in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The data including each Broadway musical nominated for Best Musical at the Tony Awards was retrieved from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Musical">Wikipedia</a>, and the one-sentence summaries were generated with <a href="https://umgpt.umich.edu/">UM-GPT</a>.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/ilanamermelstein/539-final">GitHub repository</a> for the game is publicly available online.</p>
